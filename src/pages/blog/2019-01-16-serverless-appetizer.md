Serverless is a phrase a lot of people have heard, or learned a little about,
but may not have had much experience building a real world application with.
Until you have it's hard to know if the tradeoffs, and there are tradeoffs, vs
building a more convetional app are worth it. This is a case study of an app I
wrote which uses the majority of the patterns people might use when building a
serverless app. Lambda functions, cloud auth, DynamoDB, and statically hosted js
are all represented, as well as two languages, JavaScript and go.
