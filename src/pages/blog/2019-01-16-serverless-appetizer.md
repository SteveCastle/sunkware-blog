Serverless is a phrase a lot of people have heard, or learned a little about,
but they may not have had much experience building a real world application
with. Until you have it's hard to know if the tradeoffs, and there are
tradeoffs, vs building a more convetional app are worth it. This is a case study
of an app I wrote which uses the majority of the patterns people might use when
building a serverless app. Lambda functions, cloud auth, DynamoDB, and
statically hosted js are all represented, as well as two languages, JavaScript
and go.
